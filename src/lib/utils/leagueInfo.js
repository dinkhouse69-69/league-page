  <p>A long, long time ago, in 2011, a band of brothers came together, determined to find an outlet that overshadowed their glaring lack of athleticism. Forged in the chatrooms and WebSphere, they created a league of epic proportions. Matchups were won and lost. Numbers were crunched and ignored. Reason and rationale fell long to the wayside…</p>
  <p>Some were deemed unworthy as time passed and ultimately cast aside (i.e., don’t draft Randy Moss post-retirement). Others – arguably with what should have been criminal records – found themselves similarly excommunicated. As the smoke settled and the band migrated (from ESPN to Sleeper), ten brave soldiers remained.</p>
  <p>Today, we brothers find ourselves under the rule of a miser. A foe so ferocious, anatomically gifted, and borderline legally blind. As the 2023 season draws near, I ask you, my brothers, whomst among us has the courage to dethrone that which is Clark? Together we embark on this journey, a cohesive Crew League, with the goal of taking the trophy out of Malone.</p>
  <p>Cheers, boys, and welcome to 2023!</p>
